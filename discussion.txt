4. Jason, if you want to use the Data_Pckt struct, create and destroy them with create_pkt and delete_pkt in net_util.c, just 
   so we don't have any memory leaks.

3. Dan, before you insert code, please make sure that it compiles.  I have to comment out a lot of stuff in the net_util files in order to get things to work.  In addition, it looks like you may have to rewrite a lot of those functions.  For example, some of them reference “block_size” which we aren’t going to use.

Jason, sorry about that.  I fixed all the errors.


2. Jason, what compiler are you using?  If you're not using gcc, then we may have to worry about struct packing for packet headers and 32 vs. 64 bit alignment.

Nevermind, I'll use the iovec to read and write structs.

I’m using Apples LLVM 6.0 compiler.  I’ll see if I can switch over to gcc.

I also have LLVM/Clang v3.3 (yours is based on 3.5).

1. Jason, do you need me to handle the three way handshake, or is the lower layer SOCKS going to do that?

	Let's not worry about that right now and just focus on getting something easy working (e.g., getting UDP packets generated and sent).  Once we get that done, we can put in all of the reliability stuff. Before we work on the handshake between the proxy_remote and proxy_local, I think we need to sit down and think about all of the information that they need to exchange.  I'll have a better idea of the SOCKS related stuff in a few days, but I need to think about the coding and multipath stuff.
